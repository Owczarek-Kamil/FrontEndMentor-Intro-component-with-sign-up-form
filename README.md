# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is a solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

-    View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-    Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
     -    Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
     -    The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

Firstly, created initial HTML structure of the project with mobile-first workflow. Then I created CSS styles for the whole page. After the CSS was done I started to work on JavaScript to handle form validation. When everything was finished I decided to add success message after submiting the form.
